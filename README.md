## Examples

- [A/B Testing using Cookies](./samples/ab-testing-cookie/)
  - This folder contains a Spin application showcasing how to implement A/B testing based on a cookie.
- [A/B Testing using Key-Value Store](./samples/ab-testing-kv/)
  - This folder contains a Spin application providing different samples for doing A/B testing on Fermyon Wasm Functions.
- [A/B Testing using HTTP Headers (e.g User Agent)](./samples/ab-testing-user-agent/)
  - This folder contains a Spin application that demonstrates how to implement A/B testing based on the user agent.
- [Aggregate JSON](./samples/aggregate-json/)
  - This sample shows how to make concurrent outgoing HTTP requests and combine the results.
- [AI Sentiment Analysis](./samples/ai-sentiment-analysis/)
  - This repository contains an API that performs sentiment analysis and a simple UI to interact with it.
- [AI Sentiment Analysis (Ollama Edition)](./samples/ai-sentiment-analysis-ollama/)
  - This sample illustrates how to build an AI Sentiment Analysis API using a configurable Large Language Model (LLM) hosted on Ollama.
- [Alter Response Headers](./samples/alter-headers/)
  - This sample shows how to alter the headers as you stream a response from an origin server back to a client.
- [Auto-Complete API](./samples/auto-complete/)
  - This sample shows how you can implement an API to support autocompletion for input boxes.
- [Bulk Redirects](./samples/bulk-redirects/)
  - This sample illustrates how you could bulk redirect requests using an object to map incoming requests to a configured redirection target.
- [Cookie Parsing](./samples/parse-cookie/)
  - This sample demonstrates cookie parsing using the NPM `cookie` package.
- [Early Hints with HarperDB](./samples/early-hints-rust)
  - This sample showcases using Fermyon Wasm Functions to query HarperDB for early hints.
- [Fetch JSON](./samples/fetch-json)
  - This example shows how to fetch data via a GET request, read in JSON and return the results.
- [GeoIP](./samples/geo-ip/)
  - This sample shows how to build a library component that uses a maxminddb to provide geoip information. The application component consumes the geoip component as a dependency querying the geoip database upon HTTP request.
- [GitHub GraphQL queries](./samples/graphql-stargazer/)
  - This sample illustrates how to send GraphQL queries using a popular Rust library.
- [HTML Rewrite](./samples/html-rewrite/)
  - TypeScript and Rust implementations for a Spin app that does HTML rewriting using CSS selectors.
- [JWT Validator](./samples/jwt-validator/)
  - This folder contains a Spin application which is able to validate JWT tokens issued by any OAuth 2.0 & OpenID Connect compliant Identity Provider (or Token Issuer).
- [Large-Scale Redirects](./samples/large-scale-redirects/)
  - A high-performance, large-scale HTTP redirect service implemented as a Spin application.
- [Limit Access](./samples/limit-access/)
  - This Spin application is designed to limit access to a given origin, until a configurable point in time has reached. Incoming requests hitting the Spin application before the desired point in time has been reached, won't be forwarded to the origin. Instead a configurable HTTP status code will be returned.
- [Linode Object Storage Streaming](./samples/linode-object-storage-streaming/)
  - This is a sample function that streams a file from Linode Object storage and applies a transformation to each chunk.
- [Promo Code Validation](./samples/validate-promo-codes/)
  - This Spin application illustrates how one could validate promo codes stored in a Key Value Store.
- [Reading the Body of a POST Request](./samples/read-post/)
  - This sample illustrates how to read the body of an HTTP POST request.
- [Respond with Another Site](./samples/respond-with-another-site/)
  - This sample shows a Fermyon Wasm Function that responds to all `GET` requests with the response from another site (in this case a 'random animal facts' sample).
- [Response Header Modification](./samples/response-header-modification/)
  - This folder contains a Spin app, that is allowed to make outbound HTTP requests to the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev). Upon calling the origin (Star Wars API), the `accept` header from the incoming request is used (if not specified it's defaulting to `*/*`).
- [Rewrite for bots](./samples/rewrite-for-bots-price-hiding/)
  - This sample shows a Wasm Function that defends against price scraping while still enabling scraper bots to 'see' product information.
- [TodoMVC (VueJS + TinyGo + Key-Value Store)](./samples/todo-mvc/)
  - This Spin application consists of two major components:
    - `frontend`: Vue JS frontend for managing todos borrowed from TodoMVC
    - `api`: HTTP API exposing different endpoints for managing todos (implemented using TinyGo)
- [Traffic Filtering: Block By IP address](./samples/block-by-ip/)
  - This sample illustrates how you could block clients from accessing a particular resource by maintaining an IP address block list.
- [Traffic Filtering: Block By user country](./samples/block-by-country/)
  - This sample illustrates how you could block clients from accessing a particular resource by maintaining an Country blocklist.
- [Traffic mirroring and splitting](./samples/traffic-splitting/)
